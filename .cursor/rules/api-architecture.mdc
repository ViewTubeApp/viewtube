# API Architecture

The project uses tRPC for type-safe API communication between frontend and backend.

## API Structure

### tRPC Routers
- [src/server/api/routers](mdc:src/server/api/routers) - Main API router definitions
- `/procedures` - Individual API procedures
- `/subscriptions` - Real-time subscription handlers

### Key API Features
- Categories management
- Video management
- Comments system
- Model management
- Tags system

### API Routes
- `/api/trpc/[trpc]` - tRPC endpoint
- `/api/uploadthing` - File upload endpoint

## Database Schema
The database schema is managed using Drizzle ORM and can be found in [src/server/db/schema](mdc:src/server/db/schema).

## Authentication
Authentication is handled through secure API routes with proper session management and authorization checks.
